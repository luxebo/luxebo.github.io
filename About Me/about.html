  <h1>Who Am I</h1>
  <p>Hi, my name is Michael Yuen. I am looking for work. I worked for a few years at startups such as Microscape, Game of Silks, Prism, and Norvoc Bioscience. I graduated from USC with a Masters degree in Computer Science and graduated from UCI with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science with a specialization of Intelligence Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  I have been a Computer Scientist for the past 8 years and will use this site to showcase projects and skills that I have developed. My current interests are game development and design, VR/AR work, and improving game development knowledge overall, potentially looking into graphics/shader code. My studies focused on subjects such as Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Databases, Deep Learning, Web Technology, Game Network Architectures, and Mobile Games. In addition, I had taught subjects such as Artificial Intelligence (lead grader once, PhD funded TA another), graduate level Databases (800+ students), Software Engineering, Mobile Games, and Systems Engineering for multiple years. This site will slowly be updated as I complete more projects and gain more experience.
