    <h3>Inside Job</h3>
    This is a game built on Unity with the Photon Game Networking Architecture.
    <br>
    <br>
    Inside Job is an online multiplayer social deduction game inspired by games such as Among Us and Overcooked. Players are assigned roles such as “cops” or “robbers”. The robbers complete tasks to steal merchandise from the map, while the cops go undercover, pretending to be robbers while secretly trying to stop them. The robbers periodically can vote out members they believe to be cops. The game features whimsical art designs, cartoonish combat mechanics, and engaging social intrigue.
    <br>
    <br>
    I focused specifically on multiple tasks: integrating the Photon Cloud network architecture with our Unity game, building pieces of the game involving dead reckoning, synchronization of game objects, and fleshing out the game design, building the lobby system and creating solutions for issues such as servers being in different locations, ping issues, and room finding and creating, and leading a team of three and presenting progress weekly. Overall, the project was a fun experience and I learned a lot on game networking architectures and how to create a multiplayer game in general.

    <h3>Dungeon Smiths</h3>
    This is a mobile (Android) game built on Unity, built in a team of 6. The team used sprints to work on the project over time, using version control systems and combining work on a week by week basis.
    <br>
    <br>
    Dungeon Smiths is a dungeon runner mobile game that switches between 2D and 3D mechanics throughtout the game. The game has a 3D space in which the player navigates mazes to find and interact with objects throughout the map in order to reach the next level. Ocassionally, upon reaching specific elements on the map such as encountering an enemy, the player jumps into a minigame in the 2D space. This game is split into three distinct levels, each with handcrafted enemies, obstacles, and minigames in both 3D and 2D space, seamlessly integrating the 3D exploration mode with the 2D minigames.
    <br>
    <br>
    I focused specifically on building 2D minigames involving platformer mechanics and cutscenes. These minigames were predominantly endgame minigames, including the level 2 boss and level 3 boss. The level 2 boss was a platformer focused on jumping to a particular level of the map, similar to Jump King. The level 3 boss was a platformer designed in a similar fashion to Cuphead, focused on killing a boss through platformer mechanics. Other tasks I was in charge of included a Rat minigame destroying a large number of rats through using spells placed as particle effects, building a Minecart minigame which was a simple platforming movement minigame, and working on small tasks like the timer, cutscenes showing story elements, and adding simple menu UI for pausing and playing the game.

    <h3>Patatap Clone</h3>
    This is an app that uses different libraries in addition to html, css, and js to make a Patatap Clone. The libraries include howler.js and paper.js, for sound and animation respectively.
    <br>
    <br>
    Patatap is an application that allows the user to push letters a-z on the keyboard to create animations and music. In this case, any key pressed from a-z creates a noise along with a small circle that shrinks quickly. This application is demonstrative of howler.js and paper.js's functions and how to incorporate these functions into the code of the front-end. The howler.js allows for different sounds to be played depending on the key pressed and paper.js allows for different colored circles to appear when the keys are pressed.
    <br>
    <br>
    Note: Neither howler.js nor paper.js is my code/property and I'm merely using it to create this patatap clone. This is all for non-commercial use/practice.

    <h3>Color Game</h3>
    This is a game built on html, css, and javascript that is designed to focus on DOM manipulation and interacting with javascript with the front-end code.
    <br>
    <br>
    This game's goals are to have the user select the correct RGB color from the 6 (or 3 if the difficulty is set to Easy) colors. The user can select a color by clicking on a square. The user can reset the game by clicking on New Game or by changing the difficulty. Once a color is considered correct, all 6 clickable squares and the exterior border becomes that color. If a clicked color is incorrect, the clicked square will disappear.

    <h3>Todo List</h3>
    This is an app built on html, css, javascript, and jQuery.
    <br>
    <br>
    This application allows a user to add to a todo list, allowing a user to add new elements to the list with the input below the title, delete elements that are done by clicking the revealable button to the left of the particular element, cross out elements that are done by clicking on the element itself, and reveal and remove the user input by clicking on the plus sign. These use cases are similar to what someone needs for a checkbook and all use jQuery methods to allow the Javascript to work with the rest of the front-end code. All clickable items use jQuery's functions such as fading in and out.
