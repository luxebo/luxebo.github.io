  <h1>Who Am I</h1>
  <p>Hi, my name is Michael Yuen. I am a Unity developer at Silks. I worked for a couple years at other startups such as Microscape prior to my current position. I graduated from USC with a Masters degree in Computer Science and graduated from UCI with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science with a specialization of Intelligence Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  I have been a Computer Scientist for the past 6-7 years and will use this site to showcase projects and skills that I have developed. My current interests are game development and design, VR/AR work, and improving Unity knowledge overall, potentially looking into graphics/shader code. My studies focused on subjects such as Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Databases, Deep Learning, Web Technology, Game Network Architectures, and Mobile Games. This site will slowly be updated as I complete more projects and gain more experience.
