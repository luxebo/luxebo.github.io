Homework 6, Michael Yuen, CSCI 571, 1039985005
<br>
<br>
Hi graders, just checking if this site is ok to turn in and this site also doesn't break any academic dishonesty issues. So my plan is to go ahead and create some throwaway urls through html while privating my portfolio site for now. After the class is done, I will publicitize my website and remove all html files and urls that are related to this course. Let me know if this is fine.</p>

<p>Homework 6 update: 
CSCI 571 HW 6 Michael Yuen 1039985005
<br>
<br>
The Website link is: http://csci571hw6terahrhsfgj.azurewebsites.net/
<br>
<br>
This homework's styling was tested on both mozilla firefox and chrome- however, due to time constraints, 
the styling on google chrome's browser is not as accurate as firefox's styling. It is therefore optimal (if styling is important)
for firefox to be used over chrome when viewing this website.
<br>
<br>
Every route is viewable to find all data transmitted from TMDB. The following website link routes are links to each route (or samples of):
<br>
<br>
The two home page routes:
https://csci571hw6terahrhsfgj.azurewebsites.net/TMDBTrending
https://csci571hw6terahrhsfgj.azurewebsites.net/TMDBTVAiring
<br>
<br>
The three search routes (replace the movie or TV show with your desired query):
https://csci571hw6terahrhsfgj.azurewebsites.net/SearchMovie/Dark%20Knight
https://csci571hw6terahrhsfgj.azurewebsites.net/SearchTV/The%20Office
https://csci571hw6terahrhsfgj.azurewebsites.net/MultiSearch/The%20Avengers
<br>
<br>
And finally, the details, credits, or reviews of any movie or tv show (again replacing the query with your prefered movie/TV ID):
https://csci571hw6terahrhsfgj.azurewebsites.net/MovieDetails/24428
https://csci571hw6terahrhsfgj.azurewebsites.net/MovieCredits/24428
https://csci571hw6terahrhsfgj.azurewebsites.net/MovieReviews/24428
https://csci571hw6terahrhsfgj.azurewebsites.net/TVDetails/2316
https://csci571hw6terahrhsfgj.azurewebsites.net/TVCredits/2316
https://csci571hw6terahrhsfgj.azurewebsites.net/TVReviews/2316

<br>
<br>
I did not monitor github commits and push one by one into this repo if that is of need. Sorry about that.
