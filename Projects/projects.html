    <h3>Patatap Clone</h3>
    This is an app that uses different libraries in addition to html, css, and js to make a Patatap Clone. The libraries include howler.js and paper.js, for sound and animation respectively.
    <br>
    <br>
    Patatap is an application that allows the user to push letters a-z on the keyboard to create animations and music. In this case, any key pressed from a-z creates a noise along with a small circle that shrinks quickly. This application is demonstrative of howler.js and paper.js's functions and how to incorporate these functions into the code of the front-end. The howler.js allows for different sounds to be played depending on the key pressed and paper.js allows for different colored circles to appear when the keys are pressed.
    <br>
    <br>
    Note: Neither howler.js nor paper.js is my code/property and I'm merely using it to create this patatap clone. This is all for non-commercial use/practice.

    <h3>Color Game</h3>
    This is a game built on html, css, and javascript that is designed to focus on DOM manipulation and interacting with javascript with the front-end code.
    <br>
    <br>
    This game's goals are to have the user select the correct RGB color from the 6 (or 3 if the difficulty is set to Easy) colors. The user can select a color by clicking on a square. The user can reset the game by clicking on New Game or by changing the difficulty. Once a color is considered correct, all 6 clickable squares and the exterior border becomes that color. If a clicked color is incorrect, the clicked square will disappear.

    <h3>Todo List</h3>
    This is an app built on html, css, javascript, and jQuery.
    <br>
    <br>
    This application allows a user to add to a todo list, allowing a user to add new elements to the list with the input below the title, delete elements that are done by clicking the revealable button to the left of the particular element, cross out elements that are done by clicking on the element itself, and reveal and remove the user input by clicking on the plus sign. These use cases are similar to what someone needs for a checkbook and all use jQuery methods to allow the Javascript to work with the rest of the front-end code. All clickable items use jQuery's functions such as fading in and out.

    <h3>AP Art Studio 2D Portfolio</h3>
    This is an image gallery of previously created artwork during my high school years. All of the artwork seen in each page (e.g. my home page's acryllic painting) are from a 2D Portfolio that I had done years ago.
    <br>
    <br>
    Just a note: do not use this artwork on other sites/areas without permission/credit. This artwork is only displayed as more practice for html/css grid designs.
