			<p>Dungeon Smiths is a dungeon runner mobile game that switches between 2D and 3D mechanics throughtout the game. The game has a 3D space in which the player navigates mazes to find and interact with objects throughout the map in order to reach the next level. Ocassionally, upon reaching specific elements on the map such as encountering an enemy, the player jumps into a minigame in the 2D space. This game is split into three distinct levels, each with handcrafted enemies, obstacles, and minigames in both 3D and 2D space, seamlessly integrating the 3D exploration mode with the 2D minigames.</p>

			<p>Here are some images and videos of the game. The final videos are posted here. The overall project was a good experience; I learned a lot doing transitions between 2D and 3D spaces, which is something unique and different in game creation.</p>
