Hi graders, just checking if this site is ok to turn in and this site also doesn't break any academic dishonesty issues. So my plan is to go ahead and create some throwaway urls through html while privating my portfolio site for now. After the class is done, I will publicitize my website and remove all html files and urls that are related to this course. Let me know if this is fine.</p>
