  <h1>Who Am I</h1>
  <p>Hi, my name is Michael Yuen. I am a Tech Lead at Robot Sea Monster Games, an indie game development studio. Recently, I've been the tech lead of a massive VR RTS game (Stellar Dust)- this project has been the culmination of my entire computer science career and I believe with this project's completion (or close to), I will have completed a major life goal. The results speak for themselves- it is one of the most unique games out there. I have to thank the team at Robot Sea Monster Games for designing, helping develop, and allowing me to do some architecture/project managing work to lead the development side of Stellar Dust.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before this, I worked for a few years at startups such as Microscape, Prism, Norvoc Bioscience, and Game of Silks. I graduated from USC with a Masters degree in Computer Science and graduated from UCI with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science with a specialization of Intelligence Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  I have been a Computer Scientist for the past 8 years and will use this site to showcase projects and skills that I have developed. My current interests are game development and design, VR/AR work, and improving game development knowledge overall. My studies focused on subjects such as Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Databases, Deep Learning, Web Technology, Game Network Architectures, and Mobile Games. In addition, I had taught subjects such as Artificial Intelligence (lead grader once, PhD funded TA another), graduate level Databases (800+ students), Software Engineering, Mobile Games, and Systems Engineering for multiple years.
