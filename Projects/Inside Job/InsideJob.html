			<h1>A game by Michael Yuen, Christian Glover, and Xavier Negron</h1>
			<br>
			<h3>You and your team of janitors were assigned to clean up a museum. Little do the museum owners know that your team is full of robbers and gangsters deciding to raid a museum full of riches; if you and your team are successful, you will fill your coffers full of money for years to come. However, your team may not have the same goals, there may be hidden undercover cops in your team, waiting to bust your operation wide open, neutral parties that have snuck in and decided to stay, and nefarious third parties that have the power to destroy your entire team for questionable reasons. This is the fate of inside men, who are on an inside job...</h3>

			<p>Inside Job is an online multiplayer social deduction game inspired by games such as Among Us and Overcooked. Players are assigned roles such as “cops” or “robbers”. The robbers complete tasks to steal merchandise from the map, while the cops go undercover, pretending to be robbers while secretly trying to stop them. The robbers periodically can vote out members they believe to be cops. The game features whimsical art designs, cartoonish combat mechanics, and engaging social intrigue.</p>

			<p>Here are some images and videos of the game. Both the midterm and final videos are posted here, along with the map layout and some concept art. The plan is to continue development into Summer and flesh the game out significantly in the front-end: currently the back-end and network infrastructure is in place, but the front-end needs work.</p>
