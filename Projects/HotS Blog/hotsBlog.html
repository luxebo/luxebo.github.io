		<p>Heroes of the Storm is a game I've been playing since 2015, Johanna/Kael'thas patch. As soon as the game launched I thoroughly enjoyed it and constantly look forward to playing it depending on the meta and the current status of development. In comparison to other Moba's such as DOTA 2 and League of Legends I prefer this game for it's simplicity and cool strategies in the way the game plays out. I am currently a master level player that doesn't like hero league and prefers to play in bigger groups, but I spend a lot of time doing analysis of different hero picks in games and testing different weird and unorthodox strategies. This is my documentation of my experience and this page will be updated over time of what I think of the game each update.</p>

				<h3>Tier Lists</h3>
				<p>These are a set of tier lists focused on roles. Picking certain heroes give a better chance of winning depending on the meta and map, but overall hero drafting is very situationally dependent: in the end the most important thing is how comfortable one is on the hero selected and how the hero works in tandem of other picks. The key is to identify a way of winning and draft aroudn that strategy. The easiest way is to go with mechanically simpler heroes with less combos/flashy things and just simply win due to brute force of the hero composition selected. For example, Hammer comp is very easy to execute and is easier to run than combo oriented/dive oriented comps. When it doubt however, picking the best hero is generally a good way to draft regardless of certain counters and niche picks.
				<br>
				<br>
				These are of my opinion and skill level can change the picks (e.g. Gazlowe with a one trick is different than just Gazlowe with any random player). Also, explanations and builds will follow per tier list. Clicking on a hero will open a comment, build, and additional information of why I put that hero there in the tier list. There is a tier list for all heroes, Main tanks, Offlane/Solo Laners, Ranged/Melee DPS, and Supports.</p>

				<h3>Solo Lane Matchups</h3>
				<p>This is a grid of solo lane matchups with not only matching the heroes against each other and comparing power levels, but also giving tips between interactions of each pair of heroes. This is subjective and depends on skill level of both solo laners. This also depends on map, which some maps have less priority of the solo lane/lanes, and drafts, especially if teamfight is focused more than the solo lane. Simply put the matchup is situational and solo lane requires constant readjustment against the opponent.</p>
